### My_Lab

##### Intro

This is my own website, where I will use as much as what I have learned to build somethings interesting, as well as record my study progress and issues.



### Aims

To be a great software engineer, first I should have a good taste of code and follow the rules and habits that a good developer should have.

1. Focus on details
   - Treat work or demo seriously , currently I am learning the web development, thus I should care about my website designs, user experience, performance optimization, follow the rules and best practices.
2. Right Configuration & Code style
   - Be clear about the tools configuration, concepts, always use ESlints
3. Clear commits & Honing skills
   - Every commit should be clear enough with proper description and try to do different demos to hone the coding skills, learning the concepts from doing.
